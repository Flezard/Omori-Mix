Create a flash effect over the game.

Value 1: Color (in Hexidecimal) 
(ex: "000000" "FFFFFF" "30A0F0") 
FOLLOWED BY Duration (in Seconds) 
so value1 could for example be FFFFFF, 5
Value 2: The Camera the flash acts upon. Can be either game, hud, or other.
writing the full names (camGame, camOther, camHUD) also seems to work?
not sure
